```{admonition} Reminder! - Grade Recovery Opportunity

Complete the [Kaggle: Learn Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) course by Tuesday, November 26 at 5:00pm for an opprtunity to recover some points.  You will need to meet with me in person to provide proof of completion by logging into your Kaggle account and showing me the completion status. I reserve the right to ask you to demonstrate your knowledge of the material.

You can use it to:

1. Replace your lowest Knowledge Check grade (beyond the 3 lowest that are already dropped) with a 100% grade. This option is available for Knowledge Checks 1-7 only. This is a one-time opportunity and cannot be used for Knowledge Checks due after November 7, 2024.  

-or-

2. Add up to 33 points to your lowest Programming Assignment grade from Programming Assignments 1-3 (the revised grade cannot exceed 100). This is a one-time opportunity and cannot be used for Programming Assignments due after November 7, 2024.
